# ChatApp

This repository contains implementation (backend and frontend) for a chat service.

You can use it to figure out how to create your own chat, get some architecture insights and etc.

For me it's a sandbox for trying new ideas and trying new technologies. 

Frontend tech stack:
- iOS 

Backend tech stack:
- Go
- MongoDB

Network:
- WebSocket
- LongPolling
- HTTP/2
- SSE (HTTP/2)

- JSON
- BSON
- Protobuf
- MsgPack

## How to work with

Backend implementations is in [backends](backends/) directory. 

Frontend implementation is in [clients](clients/) directory.

Each directory contains its own documentations. 

Good Luck (:
